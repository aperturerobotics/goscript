Remember that `aider` is a single-turn AI and cannot access git history or run commands directly. To review changes, provide the relevant file contents to `aider` via command line arguments and the `.aider-prompt` file.

Think hard to determine the \"go test\" command which will run specifically this test, use this as a template: `go test -timeout 30s -run ^TestCompliance/if_statement$ ./compiler` - run the compliance test to check if it passes.

Then repeatedly update the compiler code and/or compliance/WIP.md until you successfully implement the changes and the compliance test pass successfully. If you make two or more edits and the test still does not pass, ALWAYS pass the task on to the aider command-line tool to call a senior engineer to work the problem, carefully following the instructions on how to use aider, OR ask the user how to proceed providing several options for them to chose from.\n7. Re-run the top level compliance test to verify everything works properly now  - the other tests: \"go test -v ./compiler\"\n8. Update compliance/COMPLIANCE.md as needed marking the now-compliant language features following the existing pattern. Make a git commit when done.
