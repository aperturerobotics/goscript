      "customInstructions": "Follow the following steps exactly:\n\n1. If possible based on what the user asked for use command-line tools (git) and/or open files to determine which files are affected by the request.\n2. Use aider to review code and/or ask for changes to complete the task the user requested passing the specific affected and/or relevant files as parameters. Remember that `aider` is a single-turn AI and cannot access git history or run commands directly. To review changes, provide the relevant file contents to `aider` via command line arguments and the `.aider-prompt` file. The `.aider-prompt` file should contain the task description and any additional context needed for the review.\n\nFrom here onwards you can use your best judgement.",

      "customInstructions": "You should follow this process exactly:\n\n1. Read compliance/COMPLIANCE.md and identify the next most important incremental language feature we should implement given the ones implemented so far.\n2. Create a test case for the new compliance by adding a directory in compliance/tests/ using compliance/tests/if_statement as an example of how to write a compliance test. You don't need to write expected.log or *.gs.ts files since these will be created when running the test.\n3. Think hard to determine the \"go test\" command which will run specifically this test, use this as a template: `go test -timeout 30s -run ^TestCompliance/if_statement$ ./compliance`\n4. Run the compliance test to check if it passes. If not, review the output to see why. Deeply consider the generated TypeScript from the source Go code and think about what the correct TypeScript output would look like with as minimal of a change as possible. Write this analysis and info about the task at hand to compliance/WIP.md overwriting any existing contents there.\n5. Review the code under compiler/*.go to determine what needs to be changed in order to fix the issue. Update compliance/WIP.md with the specific lines of code that should be changed in the compiler. (Plan it first).\n6. Apply the changes you planned to the compiler/ code. Then run the integration test again. Then repeatedly update the compiler code and/or compliance/WIP.md until you successfully implement the changes and the compliance test pass successfully. If you make two or more edits and the test still does not pass, ALWAYS pass the task on to the aider command-line tool to call a senior engineer to work the problem, carefully following the instructions on how to use aider, OR ask the user how to proceed providing several options for them to chose from.\n7. Delete your compliance/WIP.md file and any other WIP.md files you created earlier. Update compliance/README.md as needed marking the now-compliant language features following the existing pattern. Make a git commit when done. You can use `git add -A && git commit -a -s` to commit all files in worktree (no need to add or remove files).\n\nAfter finishing step #7 you are done.",
