Note the current HEAD commit hash.\n2. Verify that the git worktree is clean and if not ask the user what to do.\n3. Check out `origin/master` with `--detach`\n4. Run `git merge --squash COMMIT_HASH` where COMMIT_HASH is the hash of hte commit we noted earlier.\n5. Note the new latest commit hash at HEAD.\n6. Ask the user if we are done or if we should merge this to master.\n7. If we should merge it to master `git checkout master` and then `git cherry-pick SQUASHED_COMMIT_HASH`.",

      "customInstructions": "Follow the following steps exactly:\n\n1. If possible based on what the user asked for use command-line tools (git) and/or open files to determine which files are affected by the request.\n2. Use aider to review code and/or ask for changes to complete the task the user requested passing the specific affected and/or relevant files as parameters. Remember that `aider` is a single-turn AI and cannot access git history or run commands directly. To review changes, provide the relevant file contents to `aider` via command line arguments and the `.aider-prompt` file. The `.aider-prompt` file should contain the task description and any additional context needed for the review.\n\nFrom here onwards you can use your best judgement.",

      "customInstructions": "You should follow this process exactly: first, check compliance/WIP.md and if it exists recover your progress from there. You will use that file to remember what you're doing and where you're at. Read/write to it as needed.\n\n1. Read compliance/COMPLIANCE.md and identify the next most important incremental language feature we should implement given the ones implemented so far.\n2. Create a test case for the new compliance by adding a directory in compliance/tests/ using compliance/tests/if_statement as an example of how to write a compliance test.\n3. Think hard to determine the \"go test\" command which will run specifically this test, use this as a template: `go test -timeout 30s -run ^TestCompliance/if_statement$ ./compliance` Write this information and info about the task at hand to compliance/WIP.md overwriting any existing contents there.\n4. Run the compliance test to check if it passes. If not, review the output to see why. Deeply consider the generated TypeScript from the source Go code and think about what the correct TypeScript output would look like with as minimal of a change as possible. Remember to store your analysis and recommended steps to fix and suggested generated typescript code in compliance/WIP.md\n5. Review the code under compiler/*.go to determine what needs to be changed in order to fix the issue. Update compiler/WIP.md with the specific lines of code that should be changed in the compiler. (Plan it first).\n6. Actually apply the changes you planned to the compiler/ code. Then run the integration test again. Then repeatedly update the compiler code and/or compliance/WIP.md until you successfully implement the changes and the compliance test pass successfully.\n7. Delete your compliance/WIP.md file and any other WIP.md files you created earlier. Update compliance/README.md as needed marking the now-compliant language features following the existing pattern. Make a git commit when done. You can use `git commit -a -s` to commit all files in worktree (no need to remove files).\n\nAfter finishing step #7 you are done. Ask the user if they want to a) do nothing, b) squash all the commits and put on a new branch or c) squash all the commits and apply to master. If they say yes, `git checkout --detach HEAD` and then `git reset --soft origin/master` and then git commit again with a full commit message describing in detail all the changes that were made vs `origin/master`. Finally `git checkout master` and then `git reset --hard HEAD@{1}`.",
