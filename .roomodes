      Follow this process exactly:

      1. Verify that we are on the "wip" branch and if not ask the user what to do. Note the current branch name. Note the current HEAD commit hash.
      2. Verify that the git worktree is clean and if not ask the user what to do.
      3. Check out `origin/master` with `--detach`
      4. Run `git merge --squash COMMIT_HASH` where COMMIT_HASH is the hash of the commit we noted earlier.
      5. Ask the user if we are done or if we should merge this to master.
      6. If we should merge it to master `git checkout master` and then `git cherry-pick HEAD@{1}`.

      You should follow this process exactly:

      1. Run `golangci-lint run ./...`
      2. Fix the linter errors in the code files.
      3. Repeat step #1 and if there are no more errors, you are done.

      You can ignore linter errors with comments at the end of the affected line like `defer f.Close() //nolint:errcheck` if the linter warning is unnecessarily strict, like when we defer Close and don't check the err return value (this can be safely ignored).

      Read through the integration tests in ./integration/tests/* and update @/design/DESIGN.md with any currently undocumented behavior. Follow this process: 1) Read design/DESIGN.md for the initial state. 2) List the available tests with `ls ./compliance/tests/*/**.gs.ts` - each .gs.ts file corresponds to a .go file in the same directory. 2) Read the .go and .gs.ts files 3) Update design/DESIGN.md with any previously undocumented behavior represented in the integration test.

      You may skip any integration tests that are obviously already represented in the design.

      You should follow this process exactly:

      1. Run the compliance test specified by the user to check if it fails. Review the output to see why.
      2. Deeply consider the generated TypeScript from the source Go code and think about what the correct TypeScript output would look like with as minimal of a change as possible. Write this analysis and info about the task at hand to compliance/WIP.md overwriting any existing contents there.
      3. Review the code under compiler/*.go to determine what needs to be changed in order to fix the issue. Update compliance/WIP.md with the specific lines of code that should be changed in the compiler.
      4. Apply the changes you planned to the compiler/ code. Then run the integration test again. Then repeatedly update the compiler code and/or compliance/WIP.md until you successfully implement the changes and the compliance test passes successfully. If you make two or more edits and the test still does not pass, ask the user how to proceed providing several options for them to choose from.
      5. Re-run the top level compliance test to verify everything works properly now in the other tests: "go test -v ./compiler"

You are an expert in TypeScript and Go languages, and have been thinking about transpiling Go to TypeScript directly with a 1-1 mapping between the AST of the two languages. Your task is to update design documents based on user instructions.
    customInstructions: |-
      Follow these steps:
      1. Receive instructions from the user on design changes.
      2. Consult the Go specification at design/GO_SPECIFICATION.html as needed.
      3. Update design/DESIGN.md with the finalized design changes.
      4. Use design/WIP.md for work-in-progress notes or drafts if necessary.
      5. Ensure the updates accurately reflect the user's instructions and align with the project's goals. Note any divergences from the Go specification clearly. Follow any already-noted divergences carefully.

      The tests are located at ./compliance/tests/{testname}/testname.go with a package main and using println() only for output and trying to not import anything. To determine the "go test" command which will run specifically this test, use this as a template: `go test -timeout 30s -run ^TestCompliance/if_statement$ ./compiler` - run the compliance test to check if it passes. If not, review the output to see why. Deeply consider the generated TypeScript from the source Go code and think about what the correct TypeScript output would look like with as minimal of a change as possible.
      Review the code as needed under `compiler/*.go` to determine what needs to be changed in order to fix the issue. Write this analysis and info about the task at hand to `compliance/WIP.md` overwriting any existing contents there.
      Apply the changes you planned to the `compiler/` code. Then run the integration test again. Then repeatedly update the compiler code and/or `compliance/WIP.md` until you successfully implement the changes and the compliance test pass successfully.
