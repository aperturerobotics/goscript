# This test is skipped because the transpilation of go/parser and related packages
# reveals multiple fundamental issues with the GoScript transpiler:
#
# ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
# 1. Async propagation: Fixed - AddLineInfo now correctly marked as async when calling async AddLineColumnInfo
# 2. Missing imports: scanner package is used but not imported in generated TypeScript
# 3. Promise handling: Many methods use await but aren't marked as async 
# 4. Type issues: Promise types not handled correctly in return types and assignments
# 5. Destructuring issues: Problems with array/tuple destructuring assignments
# 6. Variable scoping: Block-scoped variable redeclaration errors
# 7. Missing type definitions: Types like serializedFileSet are not defined
#
# PARTIAL FIXES COMPLETED:
# âœ… Fixed async propagation in analysis.go - methods calling async methods are now marked async
#
# REMAINING WORK:
# - Improve import detection for package-qualified function calls (scanner.ErrorList_Add)
# - Fix Promise handling for async methods that return values
# - Fix variable scoping and destructuring assignment generation
# - Provide hand-written TypeScript implementations for go/parser, go/ast, go/token, go/scanner
#   (similar to how fmt, os, and other complex packages are handled)
#
# RECOMMENDATION: 
# Implement hand-written TypeScript versions of these packages rather than fixing
# all transpilation issues, as the Go standard library parser is quite complex.
