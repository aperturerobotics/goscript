# This test is expected to fail due to multiple issues in complex standard library package transpilation
#
# ISSUE: When using complex Go standard library packages like go/scanner and go/token,
# the automatic transpilation reveals multiple fundamental issues:
# 1. Async/await mismatches in generated TypeScript
# 2. Missing imports within transpiled packages 
# 3. Type definition issues (missing types, incorrect Promise handling)
# 4. Variable scoping and destructuring problems
#
# This test demonstrates that transpiling complex Go packages like go/scanner exposes
# cascading issues throughout the transpiler that need to be addressed systematically.
#
# The main error patterns include:
# - "await" can only be used inside an "async" function
# - Missing type definitions (serializedFileSet, etc.)
# - Sort interface compatibility issues
# - Promise type handling problems
#
# TO FIX: This requires systematic improvements to:
# 1. Async propagation (partially fixed)
# 2. Import generation for transpiled packages
# 3. Type definition generation
# 4. Promise/async handling throughout the transpiler
