# Protobuf Lite TS

This directory contains a .proto file with a example message. We generate two files with protobuf-go-lite and protobuf-es-lite:

- protobuf_lite_ts.pb.ts: generated by protobuf-go-lite
- protobuf_lite_ts.pb.ts: generated by protobuf-es-lite

When running in Go we use the protobuf-go-lite generated file, and when running in TS we use the protobuf-es-lite generated file.

When we generate a TypeScript package with Goscript for protobuf_lite_ts we need to recognize the presence of the .pb.ts file and use it instead of attempting to transpile the .pb.go file.

The api may not be 1-1 equivalent to the Go version so we may need to add some special handling to the Goscript compiler to handle the differences.
