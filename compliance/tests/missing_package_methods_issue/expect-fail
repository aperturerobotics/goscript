# This test is expected to fail due to missing method implementations in standard library packages
#
# ISSUE: The TypeScript implementations of Go standard library packages are incomplete.
# The `slices` package is missing several methods that exist in Go 1.22+:
# - slices.Delete(slice, start, end)
# - slices.BinarySearchFunc(slice, target, cmp)
#
# This results in:
# - Runtime errors: "TypeError: slices.Delete is not a function"
# - TypeScript errors: "Property 'Delete' does not exist on type..."
#
# TO FIX: Either:
# 1. Implement missing methods in gs/slices/slices.ts, or
# 2. Improve automatic transpilation of Go standard library packages, or
# 3. Use fallback implementations when hand-written versions are incomplete
