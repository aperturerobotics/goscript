--- Testing make() with slices ---
--- Basic make with length only ---
len(s1): 5
cap(s1): 5
--- Make with length and capacity ---
len(s2): 3
cap(s2): 10
--- Make bytes with zero length, large capacity ---
len(b1): 0
cap(b1): 100000
--- Make bytes with length and capacity ---
len(b2): 10
cap(b2): 50
--- Make with zero capacity ---
len(s3): 0
cap(s3): 0
--- Make with equal length and capacity ---
len(s4): 7
cap(s4): 7
--- Append to slice with extra capacity ---
Before append - len: 2 cap: 5
After append - len: 3 cap: 5
s5[2]: 30
--- Append to bytes with extra capacity ---
Before append - len: 1 cap: 10
After append - len: 2 cap: 10
b3[0]: 65
b3[1]: 66
--- Large capacity slice ---
len(large): 5
