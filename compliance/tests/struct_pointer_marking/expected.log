=== Struct Pointer Marking Test ===

--- Scenario 1: Composite Literal vs Value Variable ---
struct value -> MyStruct assertion: true
struct value -> *MyStruct assertion: false
struct pointer -> MyStruct assertion: false
struct pointer -> *MyStruct assertion: true

--- Scenario 2: Variable Aliasing ---
original value -> MyStruct assertion: true
original value -> *MyStruct assertion: false
alias pointer -> MyStruct assertion: false
alias pointer -> *MyStruct assertion: true

--- Scenario 3: Multiple Pointers to Same Variable ---
first pointer -> *MyStruct assertion: true
second pointer -> *MyStruct assertion: true
shared modification check: 99

--- Scenario 4: Mixed Assignment Patterns ---
variable pointer -> *MyStruct assertion: true
literal pointer -> *MyStruct assertion: true

--- Scenario 5: Nested Type Assertions ---
arr[ 0 ] is *MyStruct with value: 70
arr[ 1 ] is MyStruct with value: 80
arr[ 2 ] is *MyStruct with value: 80

--- Scenario 6: Type Switch ---
testItems[ 0 ] is MyStruct value: 100
testItems[ 1 ] is *MyStruct pointer: 200
testItems[ 2 ] is int: 300
testItems[ 3 ] is string: string
