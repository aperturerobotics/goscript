**Issue:** `TypeError: Cannot create property '1' on number '110'` in `slice.gs.ts` when appending to a slice of slices.

**Analysis:** The `$.append` function in `gs/builtin/builtin.ts` was incorrectly flattening slice arguments when they were intended to be appended as single elements to a slice of slices. This behavior is correct for `Uint8Array` (byte slices) but not for generic slices of slices, where `append(s, x)` (without `...`) should append `x` as a single element.

**Fix Implemented:** Modified the `append` function in `gs/builtin/builtin.ts` to differentiate between `Uint8Array` and generic slice appends. For generic slices, the `elements` varargs are now treated as individual elements to append, without flattening nested slices unless explicitly spread by the transpiler.

**Current Status:** The `TypeError` is resolved. The `go test` command for `TestCompliance/slice` still reports a failure, but the output indicates this is due to a separate issue: "no .go files found in /Users/cjs/repos/goscript/compliance/tests/generics_leading_int". This suggests the overall `TestCompliance` suite is failing due to a misconfigured test case in a different directory, not the `slice` test itself.

**Next Steps:** Re-run the `TestCompliance/slice` specifically to confirm its success.
