# Wrapper Type Args Test Analysis - COMPLETED ✅

## Issue
The `wrapper_type_args` compliance test was failing because method calls on wrapper types (like `os.FileMode`) were being generated incorrectly in TypeScript.

## Current Behavior (FIXED)
Previously, in the generated TypeScript, when calling methods on wrapper types, the compiler generated:
```typescript
perm.String()  // ERROR: String is not a function on number
mode.String()  // ERROR: String is not a function on number
```

## Expected Behavior (NOW WORKING)
For wrapper types, method calls are now generated as standalone function calls:
```typescript
os.FileMode_String(perm)  // ✅ Correct: calls wrapper function
MyMode_String(mode)       // ✅ Correct: calls wrapper function  
```

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `IsNamedBasicType` function in `analysis.go` and the `writeWrapperTypeMethodCall` function in `expr-call.go`.

### The Problem with os.FileMode
Looking at the debug output:
```
DEBUG IsNamedBasicType: Starting traversal for type: os.FileMode
DEBUG IsNamedBasicType: Current type in traversal: os.FileMode (*types.Alias)
DEBUG IsNamedBasicType: Processing alias: os.FileMode -> uint32
DEBUG IsNamedBasicType: Current type in traversal: uint32 (*types.Basic)
DEBUG IsNamedBasicType: Reached final type: uint32 (*types.Basic)
DEBUG IsNamedBasicType: Type chain leads to basic type but no methods found
```

`os.FileMode` is a type alias that points directly to `uint32`, and there are no named types with methods in the chain. Even though wrapper functions like `os.FileMode_String` exist in the generated TypeScript, the type traversal wasn't detecting this as a wrapper type.

### Working Case: MyMode
Custom types like `MyMode` worked correctly because:
1. They are defined as `type MyMode os.FileMode` (named type, not alias)
2. They have methods explicitly defined on them
3. `IsNamedBasicType` correctly identified them as wrapper types
4. Method calls got generated as `MyMode_String(mode)`

### Failing Case: os.FileMode (FIXED)
Built-in type aliases like `os.FileMode` failed because:
1. They are type aliases, not named types
2. The alias doesn't have methods directly attached 
3. `IsNamedBasicType` returned `false`
4. Method calls got generated as `mode.String()` instead of `os.FileMode_String(mode)`

## Solution Implemented ✅

### 1. Enhanced `IsNamedBasicType` function
Rewrote the function to traverse the `Underlying()` chain and check if any type in the chain has methods. This correctly handles complex type alias chains.

### 2. Enhanced `writeWrapperTypeMethodCall` function  
Added special handling for type aliases to basic types that might have wrapper functions, even if `IsNamedBasicType` returns `false`. The logic now:

1. First checks if `IsNamedBasicType` returns `true`
2. If not, checks if the type is a type alias to a basic type
3. If so, treats it as a potential wrapper type and attempts to generate the wrapper function call pattern

## Test Results ✅
```
=== RUN   TestCompliance/wrapper_type_args
=== RUN   TestCompliance/wrapper_type_args/Compile ✅
=== RUN   TestCompliance/wrapper_type_args/Run ✅  
=== RUN   TestCompliance/wrapper_type_args/Compare ✅
=== RUN   TestCompliance/wrapper_type_args/TypeCheck ✅
--- PASS: TestCompliance/wrapper_type_args (0.88s)
```

The output now correctly matches the expected Go output:
```
TestFileMode called with mode=-rw-r--r--
TestFileMode called with mode=-rwxr-xr-x
TestMyMode called with mode=755, executable=true
TestMyMode called with mode=600, executable=false
MkdirAll called with path=/tmp/test, perm=-rwx------
TestFileMode called with mode=-rw-r--r--
TestFileMode called with mode=-rwxrwxrwx
Test completed
```

## Changes Made
1. **compiler/analysis.go**: Rewrote `IsNamedBasicType` to traverse type chains properly
2. **compiler/expr-call.go**: Enhanced `writeWrapperTypeMethodCall` to handle type aliases to basic types

The fix ensures that both custom wrapper types (like `MyMode`) and built-in type aliases (like `os.FileMode`) generate correct wrapper function calls instead of direct method calls on primitive values.
