# Build Tags Compliance Test Analysis

## ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

The build tags compliance test is now **PASSING**! 

## Issue Description

Created a new compliance test `build_tags` to verify that the compiler correctly handles GOOS and GOARCH build constraints. The test should:

1. Compile only files with `//go:build js` tags when GOOS=js
2. Exclude files with `//go:build windows` or `//go:build darwin` tags
3. Always compile files with no build constraints

## Current Status ✅

✅ **Build tag filtering is working correctly** - only the appropriate files are being compiled:
- `build_tags.go` (no constraints) ✓
- `build_tags_js.go` (//go:build js) ✓  
- `build_tags_generic.go` (no constraints) ✓
- `build_tags_windows.go` (//go:build windows) ✗ (correctly excluded)
- `build_tags_darwin.go` (//go:build darwin) ✗ (correctly excluded)

✅ **Individual file exports are working** - functions are exported from their respective .gs.ts files

✅ **Index.ts selective exports are working** - only Go-exported symbols are re-exported (currently none, which is correct)

## The Real Problem

The issue is **intra-package function visibility**. In Go, all files in the same package share the same namespace, but in TypeScript, each file is a separate module.

The main file `build_tags.go` calls:
- `testJSWasm()` (defined in `build_tags_js.go`)  
- `testGeneric()` (defined in `build_tags_generic.go`)

But the generated `build_tags.gs.ts` doesn't import these functions, causing:
```
ReferenceError: testJSWasm is not defined
```

## ✅ Solution Implemented: Auto-Import Intra-Package Dependencies

The issue was **intra-package function visibility**. In Go, all files in the same package share the same namespace, but in TypeScript, each file is a separate module.

### ✅ Implementation Details

**1. Package-Level Analysis (compiler/analysis.go)**
- Added `PackageAnalysis` struct to track function definitions and calls across files
- Added `AnalyzePackage()` function that performs two-pass analysis:
  - **Pass 1**: Collect all function definitions per file
  - **Pass 2**: Analyze function calls and determine which need imports from other files

**2. Auto-Import Generation (compiler/compiler.go)**
- Modified `PackageCompiler.Compile()` to perform package analysis before file compilation
- Updated `FileCompiler.Compile()` to generate import statements for functions from other files
- Added imports like: `import { testJSWasm } from "./build_tags_js.gs.js";`

**3. No Mutable State**
- All analysis is done ahead-of-time, no state mutation during write-time
- Follows the existing pattern of analysis → compilation

## ✅ Test Results

```bash
$ go test -timeout 30s -run ^TestCompliance/build_tags$ ./compiler
ok      github.com/aperturerobotics/goscript/compiler   0.883s
```

### ✅ Generated TypeScript (build_tags.gs.ts)
```typescript
import * as $ from "@goscript/builtin/builtin.js";
import { testJSWasm } from "./build_tags_js.gs.js";
import { testGeneric } from "./build_tags_generic.gs.js";

export async function main(): Promise<void> {
    console.log("=== Build Tags Test ===")
    testJSWasm()
    testGeneric()
    console.log("=== End Build Tags Test ===")
}
```

### ✅ Build Tag Filtering Confirmed
The compiler correctly excludes platform-specific files:
```
time="2025-05-25T00:41:35-07:00" level=debug msg="compiling file" file=build_tags.go
time="2025-05-25T00:41:35-07:00" level=debug msg="compiling file" file=build_tags_generic.go  
time="2025-05-25T00:41:35-07:00" level=debug msg="compiling file" file=build_tags_js.go
```

Notice that `build_tags_windows.go` and `build_tags_darwin.go` are **NOT** compiled.

## ✅ Achievements

1. **✅ Build tags proven working**: The test passes, confirming that build tag filtering works correctly with `GOOS=js` and `GOARCH=wasm`
2. **✅ Intra-package visibility**: Functions can call each other across files in the same package via auto-generated imports
3. **✅ Package boundaries maintained**: External packages still only see Go-exported symbols via index.ts
4. **✅ Scalable solution**: This approach will work for all multi-file packages
5. **✅ No mutable state**: All analysis is done ahead-of-time following best practices

## Files Modified

1. **`compiler/analysis.go`**: Added `PackageAnalysis` struct and `AnalyzePackage()` function
2. **`compiler/compiler.go`**: Modified package and file compilation to use package analysis and generate auto-imports
3. **`compiler/decl.go`**: Already exports all functions (from previous work)

## Summary

The original goal was to test build tags, but we discovered and solved a fundamental issue with multi-file package compilation. The compiler now:

- ✅ **Correctly handles build tags** (`GOOS=js`, `GOARCH=wasm`)
- ✅ **Automatically generates imports** for intra-package function calls
- ✅ **Maintains Go semantics** where all files in a package share the same namespace
- ✅ **Follows TypeScript module system** with proper import/export statements

This is a significant improvement that will benefit all multi-file Go packages compiled to TypeScript!
