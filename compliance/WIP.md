## Current Issues

The `goroutines_selector` compliance test is failing TypeScript type checking with the following errors:

1. **Line 20**: `Type 'Box<Channel<boolean> | null>' is not assignable to type 'Box<Channel<boolean>>'`
   - The field `done` is typed as `Box<Channel<boolean>>` but we're trying to assign `null` as the default value
   - Channels in Go are nilable (can be `nil`), so TypeScript should reflect this

2. **Lines 55, 57**: `'f' is possibly 'null'`
   - `NewFoo()` returns `Foo | null` but we're calling methods on `f` without null checking

## Root Cause Analysis

Looking at the Go source code:
```go
type Foo struct {
	done chan bool
}

func NewFoo() *Foo {
	return &Foo{done: make(chan bool)}
}
```

The issue is in how the compiler generates TypeScript types for channels. In Go:
- `chan bool` can be `nil`
- When we do `&Foo{done: make(chan bool)}`, we're creating a non-nil channel
- But the type system should still allow `nil` channels

## Correct TypeScript Output

The generated TypeScript should be:

1. **Channel field type**: `$.Channel<boolean> | null` (not `$.Channel<boolean>`)
2. **Box type**: `Box<$.Channel<boolean> | null>` 
3. **Constructor parameter**: `done?: $.Channel<boolean> | null`
4. **NewFoo return**: Should return `Foo` (not `Foo | null`) since it always creates a valid object

## Expected Changes

The corrected TypeScript should look like:
```typescript
class Foo {
	public get done(): $.Channel<boolean> | null {
		return this._fields.done.value
	}
	public set done(value: $.Channel<boolean> | null) {
		this._fields.done.value = value
	}

	public _fields: {
		done: $.Box<$.Channel<boolean> | null>;
	}

	constructor(init?: Partial<{done?: $.Channel<boolean> | null}>) {
		this._fields = {
			done: $.box(init?.done ?? null)
		}
	}
	
	// ... rest unchanged
}

export function NewFoo(): Foo {  // No | null since it always returns valid object
	return new Foo({done: $.makeChannel<boolean>(0, false, 'both')})
}
```

## Compiler Changes Needed

Based on analysis of the compiler code, the following changes are needed:

### 1. Fix Channel Type Generation (Line 270-275 in compiler/type.go)

**Current code in `WriteChannelType`:**
```go
func (c *GoToTSCompiler) WriteChannelType(t *types.Chan) {
	c.tsw.WriteLiterally("$.Channel<")
	c.WriteGoType(t.Elem())
	c.tsw.WriteLiterally(">")
}
```

**Should be changed to:**
```go
func (c *GoToTSCompiler) WriteChannelType(t *types.Chan) {
	c.tsw.WriteLiterally("$.Channel<")
	c.WriteGoType(t.Elem())
	c.tsw.WriteLiterally("> | null")
}
```

This makes channels nilable by default, which matches Go semantics where `chan T` can be `nil`.

### 2. Fix Function Return Types (Optional)

The issue with `NewFoo() | null` in the current generated output appears to be related to how pointer-to-struct return types are handled. In the Go code:

```go
func NewFoo() *Foo {
	return &Foo{done: make(chan bool)}
}
```

This function always returns a valid pointer (never nil), so TypeScript should reflect this as `Foo` rather than `Foo | null`. However, this might be a broader issue with the pointer type generation and can be addressed separately.

### Root Cause
The main issue is that Go channels are nilable by default, but the compiler was generating them as non-nullable TypeScript types. This caused type mismatches when trying to initialize channel fields with `null` values.

## Progress Update

✅ **Fixed**: Channel type generation now correctly produces `$.Channel<boolean> | null`
❌ **Remaining Issues**: 
1. Line 35: `'f.done' is possibly 'null'` in `Bar()` method
2. Line 55: `'f' is possibly 'null'` in `main()` function  
3. Line 57: `'f' and 'f.done' is possibly 'null'` in `main()` function

### Analysis of Remaining Issues

The function `NewFoo()` returns `Foo | null` but in the Go code it always creates a valid object:

```go
func NewFoo() *Foo {
	return &Foo{done: make(chan bool)}
}
```

This function never returns `nil` - it always creates a new `Foo` with a valid channel. The TypeScript should reflect this. 

Two possible solutions:
1. **Fix the function return type** to be `Foo` instead of `Foo | null` 
2. **Add null checks** in the generated code where needed

### Issue Analysis
Looking at the generated code, the problem is:
- `NewFoo()` creates a `Foo` with a non-null channel (`$.makeChannel<boolean>(0, false, 'both')`)
- But TypeScript doesn't know this, so it assumes both `f` and `f.done` could be null
- In reality, the channel is never null when created via `NewFoo()`

### Proposed Fix
The cleanest fix is to ensure that when a channel is created via `make(chan T)`, it's typed as non-null in that context, while still allowing channels to be null in general (for variable declarations, etc.).
