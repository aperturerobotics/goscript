# Complete Async Analysis Refactoring - COMPLETED âœ…

## Summary
Successfully refactored the compiler to perform ALL async analysis ahead-of-time in `analysis.go` instead of doing runtime async detection during code generation. This eliminates the stack overflow issues that were occurring due to infinite recursion between `containsAsyncOperationsRuntime` and `isLocalMethodAsync`.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Analysis Phase (analysis.go)
- **Added `MethodKey` struct**: Unique identifier for methods using `{PackagePath, ReceiverType, MethodName}`
- **Added `MethodAsyncStatus` map**: Pre-computed async status for all methods
- **Added comprehensive async analysis**: `analyzeAllMethodsAsync()` processes all methods in all packages
- **Added cycle detection**: `visitingMethods` map prevents infinite recursion during analysis

### 2. Fixed Metadata Loading
- **Fixed package-level functions**: Updated `LoadPackageMetadata()` to handle both `"Type.Method"` and `"Function"` formats
- **Added time package metadata**: Created `gs/time/meta.json` with correct async methods (`Sleep`, `After`)
- **Fixed After function**: Corrected `time.After()` to return a proper channel instead of Promise

### 3. Prioritized External Package Metadata
- **External vs Local Logic**: For external packages, metadata lookup takes priority over body analysis
- **Metadata-First Approach**: External packages use metadata to determine async status, reflecting TypeScript implementation intent
- **Body Analysis for Local**: Local packages continue to use body analysis for accurate async detection

### 4. Removed Runtime Detection Components
- **Removed `awaitedCalls` field**: No longer needed for tracking call expressions
- **Removed `visitingMethods` field**: Moved to analysis phase only
- **Simplified `writeAsyncCallIfNeeded()`**: Now uses pre-computed analysis results only
- **Removed runtime async detection functions**: `isLocalMethodAsync`, `containsAsyncOperationsRuntime`

## Test Results - All Passing âœ…

### Select Statement Tests
- âœ… **util_promise**: Select with all cases returning
- âœ… **package_import_context**: Select with no cases returning  
- âœ… **select_mixed_returns**: Select with mixed return behavior
- âœ… **nil_channel**: Multiple select statements with unique variable names

### Package Import Tests  
- âœ… **package_import_csync**: csync.Mutex.Lock() correctly detected as async
- âœ… **package_import_sync**: sync.WaitGroup.Wait() correctly detected as async
- âœ… **time.Sleep()**: Package-level function correctly detected as async

## Technical Details

### Metadata Format Support
```json
{
  "asyncMethods": {
    "Sleep": true,           // Package-level function (TypeName = "")
    "WaitGroup.Wait": true   // Method on type (TypeName = "WaitGroup")  
  }
}
```

### Priority Logic
- **External Packages**: Metadata â†’ Body Analysis (fallback)
- **Local Packages**: Body Analysis only
- **No Double Detection**: Each method analyzed once, result cached

### Fixed TypeScript Implementation
- **time.After()**: Now returns `ChannelRef<Time>` instead of `Promise<Time>`
- **Proper Channel Usage**: Uses `makeChannel()` and `makeChannelRef()` correctly
- **Async Timing**: setTimeout schedules channel send after duration

## Final Status
ðŸŽ‰ **COMPLETE**: All async analysis is now performed ahead-of-time during the analysis phase. No more runtime detection, no more stack overflows, and all test cases passing successfully.

The compiler now has a clean separation:
- **Analysis Phase**: Determine all async status using metadata + body analysis  
- **Code Generation Phase**: Use pre-computed results for await insertion
