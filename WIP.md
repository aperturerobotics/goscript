# Analysis of the Box Dereferencing Issue

## Problem
In `boxing_deref_set.gs.ts`, we have an issue with dereferencing pointer variables, specifically:

1. When using `*p1` in the original Go code, the current TypeScript translation just outputs `p1.value` which is wrong
2. In this case, we need to access `p1.value!.value` because:
   - `p1` is a boxed pointer variable (Box<Box<number> | null>)
   - `p1.value` gives us the inner pointer (Box<number>)
   - `!` is needed to assert this inner value is not null
   - `p1.value!.value` gives us the actual number value (the final dereference)

## Observations
- The issue is in the `WriteStarExpr` method in compiler/compiler.go
- Current logic isn't correctly handling multiple levels of boxing
- For non-struct pointers (`*int`, etc.), we need to always add an additional `.value` access after the dereference
- When dereferencing a variable that points to a struct, we don't need this additional `.value` access due to TypeScript classes
- The issue is that our logic doesn't differentiate between dereferencing a pointer to a struct vs a pointer to a primitive type

## Required Fix
We need to modify the dereferencing logic in `WriteStarExpr` to:
1. Always apply `!.value` for dereferencing pointers to primitive types
2. Properly handle the special case for pointers to structs which don't need the additional `.value`
3. Ensure we handle multiple levels of indirection correctly
