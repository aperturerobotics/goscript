When you want to make substantial changes to code files you may ask a much much more senior engineer than you to complete a task by first writing the details of the task you want to complete and the message to the engineer to `.aider-prompt` in the workspace root and then call `aider` with the --message-file flag pointing to this file, including the filenames of all relevant code files and the files to edit as arguments. For example: `aider --no-pretty --message-file .aider-prompt source_file.go other_source_file.ts information.md` Remember that `aider` is a shell command.
