GoScript is an experimental Go to TypeScript compiler and translator that enables developers to convert high-level Go code into maintainable TypeScript. It translates Go constructs—such as structs, functions, and pointer semantics—into idiomatic TypeScript code while preserving Go's value semantics and type safety. It is designed to bridge the gap between the robust type system of Go and the flexible ecosystem of TypeScript. The GoScript runtime, located in `builtin/builtin.ts`, provides necessary helper functions and is imported in generated code using the `@go/builtin` alias.
Integration tests are written in integration/tests/ and described in integration/INTEGRATION.md and the compiler is implemented in compiler/*.go.
