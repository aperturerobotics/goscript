The compliance tests are located at ./compliance/tests/{testname}/testname.go with a package main and using println() only for output and trying to not import anything. To determine the "go test" command which will run specifically this test, use this as a template: `go test -timeout 30s -run ^TestCompliance/if_statement$ ./compiler` - when working on a compliance test, run the compliance test to check if it passes. If not, review the output to see why. Deeply consider the generated TypeScript from the source Go code and think about what the correct TypeScript output would look like with as minimal of a change as possible.
Review the code as needed under `compiler/*.go` to determine what needs to be changed in order to fix the issue. Write this analysis and info about the task at hand to `compliance/WIP.md` overwriting any existing contents there.
Apply the changes you planned to the `compiler/` code. Then run the integration test again. Then repeatedly update the compiler code and/or `compliance/WIP.md` until you successfully implement the changes and the compliance test pass successfully.
